* terms
Basic
- *declaration* - informing the compiler of name and the type of the value.
- *definition* - memory is allocated for the variable, its value should not be assumed to be anything in
 particular or with some default value.
- *initialization* - assiging value to allocated memory of variable
- *variable* - named storage location
- *literal* - a textual representation (notation) of a value as it is written in source code.
- *Constant* - A value that does not change during program execution
- *Operators* - Symbols used to perform operations on variables and values, such as arithmetic,
   logical, and relational operators. + -
- *Arrays* - Contiguous collection of elements of the same data type stored in memory under a
   single name
- *Strings* - Arrays of characters terminated by a null character ('\\0') used to represent text.
- *Preprocessor directives* - Instructions to the compiler that start with #, used for including header files,
 defining constants, and performing conditional compilation.
- *Scope* - The visibility and accessibility of variables and functions within different parts of
   a program, determined by where they are declared.
-

Advanced
- *translation unit* (or more casually a compilation unit) - the ultimate input to a C or C++ compiler from
 which an object file is generated
- *transclusion* - inclusion of part or all of an electronic document into one or more other documents by
 reference.
- *translation unit* is the output of the C preprocessor – a source file after it has been
 preprocessed. header files listed in #include directives are literally included.
- *include guard* or macro guard, header guard or file guard -  construct used to avoid the problem of double inclusion
- *lvalue* - an object that has an identifiable location in memory, cannot be a function, expression (like
 a+b) or a constant.  if ptr is a pointer, then *ptr is a modifiable l-value.
- *rvalue* - no identifiable location in memory, Anything that is capable of returning a constant expression or value.

* Hello world and compilers, main
** gcc
: $ gcc hello.c
: $ ./a.out

The default, if no C language dialect options are given, is -std=gnu17.

Published in June 2018, C17 is the current standard for the C programming language.

** hello world
  #+begin_src C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   /* my first program in C */
   printf("Hello, World! \n");

   return 0;
}
  #+end_src

** compilation stages
gcc -save-temps hello.c -o hello
- -save-temps flag is used to save all the intermediate files during compilation.
files
- hello.i (Generated by Pre-processr) - Lines starting with a # are interpreted by the preprocessor
- hello.s (Generated by Compiler) - assembly instructions, syntax errors
- hello.o (Generated by Assembler) - assembly instructions to object code.
- hello (Generated by Linker) - appending bootstrap code, linker assigned the load address to executable
** main, return type and arguments
C:
- int main(){
- int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
- int main(int argc, char **argv){


C++:
- int main(){
- int main(int argc, char **argv){
- int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
- main(){

arguments
- argc (ARGument Count) denotes the number of arguments to be passed
- argv [ ] (ARGument Vector) denotes a pointer array pointing to every argument that has been passed to your program.
- argv[0] stores the name of your program - argv[0] to argv[argc-1]
- arguments separate by space

* features, constants, comments
*procedural*
supporting:
- structured programming - n (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines.
- lexical variable scope - hide local variables of functions
- recursion
- static type system


Functions may not be defined within the lexical scope of other functions.

: typedef int length; // alias for type

member access operator (.)

Procedures - function, with an untyped return type void

A preprocessor performs macro definition, source code file inclusion, and conditional compilation.

modularity: files can be compiled separately and linked together, with control over which functions and data
objects are visible to other files via static and extern attributes.

* Linkage
When we compile a program, the ‘C’ compiler will generate object files (“.o” files. Some compilers will
generate “.obj” files.). After that linker will generate a “.out” file (or some compilers will generate “.exe”
files.). That means, it is a two steps process; one step is to compile the program and another step is to link
the object files and generate the executable file.
- object file is in binary format and it is a compiled code;

last step in compiling a program is to run *ld* - ties up symbol references.

** gcc linker
link mylib from /usr/local/lib
: gcc -L/usr/local/lib -lmylib
** types external internal
- external linkage - throughout the entire program,
- internal linkage - restricted to one source file
- no linkage respectively - restricted to one function (or perhaps a single compound statement).

** linkage select:
1. A declaration outside a function (file scope) which contains the static storage class specifier results in
 internal linkage for that name. (The Standard requires that function declarations which contain static must
 be at file scope, outside any block)
2. If a declaration contains the extern storage class specifier, or is the declaration of a function with no
 storage class specifier (or both), then:
   - If there is already a visible declaration of that identifier with file scope, the resulting linkage is the same as that of the visible declaration;
   - otherwise the result is external linkage.
3. If a file scope declaration is neither the declaration of a function nor contains an explicit storage class specifier, then the result is external linkage.
4. Any other form of declaration results in no linkage.
5. In any one source code file, if a given identifer has both internal and external linkage then the result is undefined.

** What makes a declaration into a definition?
- Declarations that result in no linkage are also definitions.
- Declarations that include an initializer are always definitions; this includes the ‘initialization’ of functions by providing their body. Declarations with block scope may only have initializers if they also have no linkage.
- Otherwise, the declaration of a name with file scope and with either no storage class specifier or with the static storage class specifier is a tentative definition. If a source code file contains one or more tentative definitions for an object, then if that file contains no actual definitions, a default definition is provided for that object as if it had an initializer of 0. (Structures and arrays have all their elements initialized to 0). Functions do not have tentative definitions.

** Storage class
 - For external declarations the default storage class specifier will be extern and for internal declarations it
 will be auto.
 - declaration of functions - default storage class specifier is always extern.


*** restrict keyword
  hints to the compiler that for the lifetime of the pointer, only the pointer itself or a value directly
  derived from it (such as pointer + 1) will be used to access the object to which it points.
  - produce better optimized code

  : void updatePtrs(size_t *restrict ptrA, size_t *restrict ptrB, size_t *restrict val);
  - hints to the compiler that for the lifetime of the pointer, only the pointer itself or a value directly
    derived from it (such as pointer + 1) will be used to access the object to which it points.

*** extern keyword
  - it is better to put extern functions and variables in header file
  # name First File: main.c
  #+begin_src C
  #include <stdio.h>

  int count ;
  extern void write_extern();

  main() {
     count = 5;
     write_extern();
  }
  #+end_src

  # name Second File: support.c
  #+begin_src C
  #include <stdio.h>

  extern int count;

  void write_extern(void) {
     printf("count is %d\n", count);
  }
  #+end_src

  Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows −

  : $ gcc main.c support.c
  : ./a.out
  > count is 5

* dynamic libraries, ldd, ldconfig
- man ld.so
- /etc/ld.so.conf - paths for shared libraries

#include "<header file name>" - static and dynamic

from .c created .so shared library, static - they are inside executables

LD_LIBRARY_PATH - used first for search .so files for program, exp. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:<your path>"

Show .so dependencies:
- safe: objdump -p /bin/bash | grep NEEDED
- unsafe: ldd /bin/bash

** cast operator: (type_name) expression

- *usual arithmetic conversions* are implicitly performed to cast their values to a common type.
- Integer Promotion - values of integer type "smaller" than int or unsigned int are converted either to int or
  unsigned int
- usual arithmetic conversions are not performed for the assignment operators, nor for the logical operators
  && and ||

Compiler first performs integer promotion; if the operands still have different types, then they are converted
to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy:
1. char
2. unsigned char
3. int
4. unsigned int
5. long
6. unsigned long
7. long long
8. unsigned long long
9. float
10. double
11. long double

inbuilt typecasting functions:
- atof() Converts a string to float
- atoi() Converts a string to int
- atol() Converts a string to long
- itoa() Converts int to string
- ltoa() Converts long to string

** Chained operators
- All languages usually "left associative" - grouping left to right so that 16/4/4 is interpreted as (16/4)/4 =
1. Chained assignment - implemented by having a right-associative assignment.
- In C, the assignment a = b is an expression that evaluates to the same value as the expression b converted
  to the type of a
- In C++, the assignment a = b is an expression that evaluates to the same value as the expression a, with the
  side effect of storing the R-value of b into the L-value of a. опреатор = является функцией класса с
  аргументом правого элемента присвоения и всегда возвращает this.

: std::cout << "Its decimal equivalent is: " << n << '\n';
здесь операторы << имеют одинаковый приоритет и выполняются слева направо. Каждый из них бинарный, возвращает
объект count, и так по порядку - слева направо.
: a = (b = c)
can be interpreted as b = c; a = c;
: (a = b) = c
raises an error in C because a = b is not an L-value expression. In C++ can be interpreted as a = b; a = c;
: a=b=c
equal to a = (b = c) in C/C++. In Python tmp=c ; a=tmp; b=tmp
: v = a=1,b=2,c=3
Присвоение имеет приоритет 16, а запятая 17 (ниже),
результат будет v=1 первого оператора, все остальные операторы выполняются только для побочного эффекта
: a= (b++,c++, v++)
a=v++
: (a=b).fun()
в С++ будет вызвана a.fun(), в С вероятно b.fun()
: a>b>c
Из за "left associative" привила, В С/С++ оператор > принимает два аргумента и возвращает int. bool = (a>b) ;
bool>c - что является не тем что хотелось бы. В Python эквивалентно a<b and b<c

- double quotes ""
- You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.

"hello, dear" // one

"hello, \
dear" // one

"hello, " "d" "ear" // one

** memory allocation
- Static memory allocation: space for the object is provided in the binary at compile-time; these objects have
  an extent (or lifetime) as long as the binary which contains them is loaded into memory.
- Automatic memory allocation: temporary objects can be stored on the stack, and this space is automatically
  freed and reusable after the block in which they are declared is exited.
  - stack space is typically much more limited and transient than either static memory or heap space
- Dynamic memory allocation: blocks of memory of arbitrary size can be requested at run-time using library
  functions such as malloc from a region of memory called the heap; these blocks persist until subsequently
  freed for reuse by calling the library function realloc or free

** structure
- all of its data members are stored in contiguous memory locations
- A function may directly return a structure, although this is often not efficient at run-time. Since C99, a
  structure may also end with a flexible array member.
- initialization: = {0, 1}
- '.' for access by value
- '->' for access by pointer

** Union
- is a structure with overlapping members; only the last member stored is valid.
- The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union.
- Последнее присвоение будет хранить корректные данные
- great cost of safety: the program logic must ensure that it only reads the field most recently written along
  all possible execution paths.

  union [union tag] {
   member definition;
   member definition;
   ...
   member definition;
} [one or more union variables];

** Array
 store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type


type arrayName [ arraySize ];
: double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0}; # 5 - size
: double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
: int a[10][8];  // array of 10 elements, each of type 'array of 8 int elements'
: double balance[5] = {1000.0}

pass to function:
- void myFunction(int *param) - Formal parameters as a pointer
- void myFunction(int param[10]) - Formal parameters as a sized array
- void myFunction(int param[]) - Formal parameters as an unsized array

example with size:
: double getAverage(int arr[], int size)

Return from function
- C programming does not allow to return an entire array as an argument to a function.
- C does not advocate to return the address of a local variable to outside of the function, so you would have
  to define the local variable as static variable.
: int * myFunction()
** Enum
https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Enum-In-C.png

Every item in the enum definition is paired to an integer, internally.
- typedef enum - alias for types. you can assign integer with =1..n
*** ex1
#+begin_src c :results output
typedef enum {
  monday, // 0
  tuesday, // 1
  wednesday, // 3
  thursday,
  friday,
  saturday,
  sunday
} WEEKDAY;

int main(void) {
  WEEKDAY day = monday; // day == 0 internally

  if (day == monday) {
    printf("It's monday!");
  } else {
    printf("It's not monday");
  }
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: It's monday!

*** ex2
#+begin_src c
// alias for type
typedef enum ActionType_ {
  ACTION_TYPE_KEY_EVENTS,
  ACTION_TYPE_MULTI_STROKE,
  ACTION_TYPE_SELECTION
} ActionType;

// declaration
// cardsuit - name of variable. Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades - list of constants
enum cardsuit {
    Clubs,
    Diamonds,
    Hearts,
    Spades
};
// instantiation
struct card {
    enum cardsuit suit; //suit is an object of type cardsuit
    short int value;
} hand[13];

// instantiation
enum cardsuit trump;

// operation
trump = Spades;
enum cardsuit b = Hearts;

// allow this
enum cardsuit {
    Clubs    = 1,
    Diamonds = 2,
    Hearts   = 4,
    Spades   = 8
};
#+end_src

** Strings
- conventionally implemented as null-terminated character arrays
- one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'.
define:
- char greeting[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
- char greeting[] = "Hello";
- ' - for char, " for string
: #include <string.h> //string operations

** Pointers
- can be dereferenced to access data stored at the address pointed to, or to invoke a pointed-to function
- Void pointers (void *) point to objects of unspecified type,
- ampersand (&) operator - access address of variable - &a; returns the actual address of the variable.
- *pointer - access variable at pointer
- NULL is a constant with value of zero
  - Dereferencing a null pointer value is undefined - often resulting in a segmentation fault
- sizeof() Returns the size of a variable.

: int *ptr[MAX]; // array of pointer to int
: char *names[] = { "Zara Ali", "Hina Ali", "Nuha Ali", "Sara Ali" }; // pinters to strings
: name[0], name[1]
*** ex
#+begin_src C
  char *square;
  long *circle;
  int *oval;

  int **oval2; // pointer of pointer
  int ***oval3; // pointer of pointer of pointer

  char *pc[10];   // array of 10 elements of 'pointer to char'
  char (*pa)[10]; // pointer to a 10-element array of char

  int (*my_int_f)(int) = &abs; // pointer of function
  // the & operator can be omitted, but makes clear that the "address of" abs is used here

#+end_src

*** dangers:
- point ot unsafe places by using invalid pointer arithmetic;
- the objects they point to may continue to be used after deallocation (dangling pointers)
- they may be used without having been initialized (wild pointers)
- directly assigned an unsafe value using a cast, union, or through another corrupt pointer

*** pointer arithmetic.
- ++, --, +, and -
- int * p = 1000
- p++
- p is now 1004  # Assuming 32-bit integers
*** function pointers

}

typedef int  (*MyFun)(int);

#+end_src

** void
specifies that no value is available
- Function returns as void
- Function arguments as void - int rand(void) = int rand()
- Pointers to void - represents the address of an object, but not its type
  - void *malloc( size_t size ) - returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.
* control structures

** switch
- expression :: tupically char or int.
- break :: exit from switch.
- default :: statement is optional, and specifies some code to run if there is no case match.
- constant-expression :: for a case must be the same data type as the variable in the switch, and it must be a
  constant or a literal.

* functions
- by default, the return type of a function is an integer(int) data type.
- A Function declaration is also known as a function prototype.
- In function declaration name of parameters are not compulsory, but we must define their datatype. Hence the
  following declaration is also valid.
  - int getSum(int, int);
- If function definition is written before the main function then function declaration is not required
  whereas, if function definition is written after the main function then we must write function declaration
  before the main function.

void - without returning a value

pass the parameters by:
- call by value
- call by reference
  - void show(int *num){}
  - change(&x);

* header files
Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file
- #include <file> - system files
- #include "file" - user-defined or external files.
what:
- prototypes of the functions contained within the library that may be used by a program, and declarations of
  special data types and macro symbols used with these functions
- all the constants, macros, system wide global variables
- function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files
- -I option while compiling your source code. to instruct directories to search for header files
- Once-Only Headers - rule - included twice = error
for
- forward declarations
- promoting encapsulation and the reuse of code or data

In order for a program to use a library, it must include the library's header file, and the library must be
linked with the program, which in many cases requires compiler flags (e.g., -lm, shorthand for "link the math
library")

: #include <file> // system header files
: #include "file" // own program - in the directory containing the current file
** Standart way to prevent "Once-Only Header"

* C - Preprocessors
- text substitution tool  - pre-processing before the actual compilation
- All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for
  readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column.
** Macro types
- Simple Macros - extend the same way
  - #define MAIN
  - #define BUFFER_SIZE 1020
  - #define BAR (x) - 1 / (x) - expand into `(x) - 1 / (x)'
  - Macro definitions do not have to have balanced parentheses.
  - multiline with '\' symbol
- Macros with Arguments
  - #define min(X, Y)  ((X) < (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
  - use: `min (1, 2)' and `min (x + 28, *p)'
  - You may not define the same name as both a simple macro and a macro with arguments.
- Stringification - turning a code into a string constant. ex: `foo (z)' results in `"foo (z)"'
  - #define WARN_IF(EXP) fprintf (stderr, "Warning: " #EXP "\n");
- Concatenation - ## operator
- Undefining Macros - #undef FOO - cancel its definition
- `#if', `#ifdef' or `#ifndef
  - `#endif' is final macro, good practice to add comment with #if expression after
  - expression is a C expression of integer type
    - `sizeof' operators and enum-type values are not allowed
  - #else
  - #elif expression
  - #if 0 #endif - good alternative to comment code
  - preprocessor does not understand sizeof, or typedef names, or even the type keywords such as int.
  - special operator `defined' is used in `#if' expressions to test whether a certain name is defined as a
    macro.  Either `defined name' or `defined (name)
- #PREDICATE (ANSWER)
  - Значением ANSWER может быть любая последоватльность слов. Здесь все символы являются значимыми, за
    исключением пробелов, расположенных в начале и в конце ANSWER
  - Большинство проверяемых утверждений являются заранее определенными.
  - GNU C предоставляет три заранее определенных утверждения: 'system', 'cpu' и 'machine'
    - #system (gnu)
    - #system (mach)
    - #system (unix) -- most common
  - deprecated alternative to macros
  - in practice they are just as unpredictable as the system-specific predefined macros. In addition, they are not part of any standard, and only a few compilers support them.
  - To test an assertion, you write it in an `#if'
    - #if #machine (vax)
    - #if #machine - can test whether any answer is asserted for a predicate by omitting the answer in the conditional
  - #assert predicate (answer)
  - You can also make or cancel assertions using command line options.
    - -A predicate=answer Make an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer answer.
    - -A -predicate=answer Cancel an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer answer.
- `#error' causes the preprocessor to report a fatal error. #warning - warning and continue
  - #error Won't work on Vaxen.  See comments at get_last_object.
- #line alter the results of the `__FILE__' and `__LINE__' predefined macros from that point on.
  - #line linenum
  - #line linenum filename
  - #line anything else

** Directive & Description
- #define - Substitutes a preprocessor macro. - constants, functions
- #include - Inserts a particular header from another file.
- #undef - Undefines a preprocessor macro.
- #ifdef - Returns true if this macro is defined.
- #ifndef - Returns true if this macro is not defined.
- #if - Tests if a compile time condition is true.
- #else - The alternative for #if.
- #elif - #else and #if in one statement.
- #endif - Ends preprocessor conditional.
- #error - Prints error message on stderr.
- #pragma - Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.

** Predefined Macros
Standart
- __DATE__ The current date as a character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format.
- __TIME__ The current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
- __FILE__ This contains the current filename as a string literal.
- __LINE__ This contains the current line number as a decimal constant.
- __STDC__ Defined as 1 when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.

Nonstandard
- unix    `unix' is normally predefined on all Unix systems.
- BSD    `BSD' is predefined on recent versions of Berkeley Unix (perhaps only in version 4.3).

Other nonstandard predefined macros describe the kind of CPU, with more or less specificity. For example,
- vax    `vax' is predefined on Vax computers.
- mc68000    `mc68000' is predefined on most computers whose CPU is a Motorola 68000, 68010 or 68020.
- m68k    `m68k' is also predefined on most computers whose CPU is a 68000, 68010 or 68020; however, some makers use `mc68000' and some use `m68k'. Some predefine both names. What happens in GNU C depends on the system you are using it on.
- M68020    `M68020' has been observed to be predefined on some systems that use 68020 CPUs--in addition to `mc68000' and `m68k', which are less specific.
- _AM29K_AM29000  Both `_AM29K' and `_AM29000' are predefined for the AMD 29000 CPU family.
- ns32000    `ns32000' is predefined on computers which use the National Semiconductor 32000 series CPU.

Yet other nonstandard predefined macros describe the manufacturer of the system. For example,
- sun    `sun' is predefined on all models of Sun computers.
- pyr    `pyr' is predefined on all models of Pyramid computers.
- sequent    `sequent' is predefined on all models of Sequent computers.
** Preprocessor Operators
- The Macro Continuation (\) Operator
- The Stringize (#) Operator - may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list
- The Token Pasting (##) Operator - insert argument to create new one
- The Defined() Operator -  to determine if an identifier is defined using #define
- Parameterized Macros
** examples

     #define MESSAGE "You wish!"
  #endif

  int main(void) {
     printf("Here is the message: %s\n", MESSAGE);
     return 0;

  #define MAX(x,y) ((x) > (y) ? (x) : (y))
  #define square(x) ((x) * (x))

  int main(void) {
     printf("Max between 20 and 10 is %d\n", MAX(10, 20));

* Error Handling <<err_handling>>
- C does not provide direct support to error handling
- Most of the C or even Unix function calls return -1 or NULL in case of any error and set an error code
*errno*.
- It is usually better to follow the practice of assigning errno to 0 at the initializing a program which helps to indicate that there are no errors in the program.

Different methods of Error handling in C
- Global Variable *errno* - Its a global variable indicating the error occurred during any function call and
  defined in the header file errno.h.
  - #include <errno.h>
  - apt-get install errno
  - errno -l
- returns textual representation of the current errno value.
  - char * strerror(int) : printf("The error message is : %s\n", strerror(errno));
- print to stderr with <stdio.h>:perror with custom text before error ( reads errno)
  - perror("Error: ");  return(-1);  - result is "Error: : No such file or directory"
  - strerror(): returns a pointer to the textual representation of the current errno value.
- The C standard specifies two constants: EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE These are macros defined in stdlib.h.
  - #include <stdlib.h>
  - exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  - exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
- Division by zero leads to undefined behavior, there is no C language construct that can do anything about
  it.
- assert.h - macro that is used to check specific conditions at runtime
  - output: Assertion failed: (b != 0), function main, file my.c, line 10
  - By using GCC, C, and C++ compilers - assertions are enabled by default.
  - to disable:
    - #define NDEBUG # in code
    - -DNDEBUG parameter for GCC commpiler
    - #define assert(ignore) ((void)0)
  - not for runtime error handling

Error handling Decision Tree: https://i.stack.imgur.com/L8wQq.png

* Libraries theory
C standard library - most common C library, which is specified by the ISO and ANSI C standards and comes with
every C implementation
- stream input and output
- memory allocation
- mathematics
- character strings
- time values

POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification. - libraries

** Minimalist C Libraries - recommendations
- (1) Small number of functions, perhaps even as little as one.
- (2) No dynamic memory allocations.
- (3) No input or output.
- (4) Define at most one structure, and perhaps even none.
-
https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/06/10/
* C Standard Library
** assert.h
macro:

void assert(int expression);

expression − This can be a variable or any C expression. If expression evaluates to TRUE, assert() does
nothing. If expression evaluates to FALSE, assert() displays an error message on stderr (standard error stream
to display error messages and diagnostics) and aborts program execution.

** ctype.h
for testing and mapping characters.

All the functions return non-zero (true) if the argument c satisfies the condition described, and zero(false)
if not.
- int isalnum(int c) This function checks whether the passed character is alphanumeric.
- int tolower(int c) This function converts uppercase letters to lowercase.
- int toupper(int c) This function converts lowercase letters to uppercase.
** errno.h
- defines the integer variable errno, which is set by system calls and some library functions in the event of
  an error to indicate what went wrong.
- zero - no error
- see [[err_handling]]
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <string.h>

extern int errno ;

int main () {
   FILE *fp;

   fp = fopen("file.txt", "r");
   if( fp == NULL ) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Value of errno: %d\n", errno);
      fprintf(stderr, "Error opening file: %s\n", strerror(errno));
   } else {
      fclose(fp);
   }

   return(0);
}
#+end_src

** float.h
floating-point number is composed of following four elements −
- S :: sign ( +/- )
- b :: base or radix of the exponent representation, 2 for binary, 10 for decimal, 16 for hexadecimal, and so
  on...
- e :: exponent, an integer between a minimum emin and a maximum emax.
- p :: precision, the number of base-b digits in the significand.

: floating-point = ( S ) p x be
: floating-point = (+/-) precision x baseexponent

The following values are implementation-specific. Note that in all instances FLT refers to type float, DBL
refers to double, and LDBL refers to long double.

** limits.h
implementation-specific, determines various properties of the various variable types types like char, int and long.

- CHAR_BIT 	8 	Defines the number of bits in a byte.
- SCHAR_MIN 	-128 	Defines the minimum value for a signed char.
- SCHAR_MAX 	+127 	Defines the maximum value for a signed char.
- UCHAR_MAX 	255 	Defines the maximum value for an unsigned char.
- CHAR_MIN 	-128 	Defines the minimum value for type char and its value will be equal to SCHAR_MIN if char represents negative values, otherwise zero.
- CHAR_MAX 	+127 	Defines the value for type char and its value will be equal to SCHAR_MAX if char represents negative values, otherwise UCHAR_MAX.
- MB_LEN_MAX 	16 	Defines the maximum number of bytes in a multi-byte character.
- SHRT_MIN 	-32768 	Defines the minimum value for a short int.
- SHRT_MAX 	+32767 	Defines the maximum value for a short int.

- LONG_MAX 	+9223372036854775807 	Defines the maximum value for a long int.
- ULONG_MAX 	18446744073709551615 	Defines the maximum value for an unsigned long int.
** locale.h
 location specific settings, such as date formats and currency symbols.
- LC_ALL Sets everything.
- LC_COLLATE Affects strcoll and strxfrm functions.

** math.h
All the functions available in this library take double as an argument and return double as the result.

- HUGE_VAL - This macro is used when the result of a function may not be representable as a floating point
  number. If magnitude of the correct result is too large to be represented, the function sets errno to ERANGE
  to indicate a range error, and returns a particular, very large value named by the macro HUGE_VAL or its
  negation (- HUGE_VAL). If the magnitude of the result is too small, a value of zero is returned instead. In
  this case, errno might or might not be set to ERANGE.

Functions:
- double acos(double x) Returns the arc cosine of x in radians.
- etc
** setjmp.h
These are used in C for exception handling.

variable: jmp_buf - This is an array type used for holding information for macro setjmp() and function
longjmp().

macro: int setjmp(jmp_buf environment) - This macro saves the current environment into the variable
*environment* for later use by the function longjmp(). If this macro returns directly from the macro invocation,
it returns zero but if it returns from a longjmp() function call, then a non-zero value is returned.

Functions: void longjmp(jmp_buf environment, int value) - Go back to place pointed by buf and return i. This
function restores the environment saved by the most recent call to setjmp() macro in the same invocation of
the program with the corresponding jmp_buf argument.

** Naming conventions
Tracitional C practice is to use lower case for variable names, and all upper case for symbolic constants.

- array - array of data
- type - usualy a enum
- node - link to other nodes
- entity - generic networking thing
- handle - pointer to opaqe data structure
- func - function pointer or function used as function pointer
- internal - function internal to a module
- i, j, k, count, length, found, next, previous, f, vec

* php naming conventions (offtopic)
- Views - mostly to keep graphical design
- Models - wrapper around database tables
- Controllers - Classes where every function is called from a route and returns a http response, like view or redirect or error (404)
- Brokers - classes to get all the calculation and logic. It is like a black box that takes what you have and gives you back exactly what you wanted. It also serves like a replacement for documentation.
- Handlers - mostly for Exception Handling and Event handling
- Services - wrappers around APIs
- Requests - to describe some inputs, it also can handle validation, authorization, typehinting, and some basic data processing, like get a model by provided id
- Middleware - to abstract out some common logic from the multiple routes, like authentication and authorization
- Helpers - some tiny classes and functions used throughout the project, like MoneyHelper or ValidationHelper
- Factory - some interfaces can have multiple implementations depending on some input parameters, so the factory would give you the right one

is a set of *sources* (or file descriptors (FDs) to check) with an associated callback function which will be
  invoked when that event is received.

is completely thread safe

At the core GMainContext is just a poll() loop or Event loop - one iteration:
- Prepare sources, determining if any of them are ready to dispatch immediately.
- Poll the sources, blocking the current thread until an event is received for one of the sources.
- Check which of the sources received an event (several could have).
- Dispatch callbacks from those sources.

g++ - automatically specifies linking against the C++ library

Language standard C/C++ opetion: -std=
- gnu17/gnu18 - GNU dialect of ISO C17.  This is the default for C code.
- gnu++17/gnu++1z - GNU dialect of -std=c++17.  This is the default for C++ code. The name gnu++1z is deprecated.
** compilation options
We suggest that you use the '-O2' switch in all of your compilations; it increases speed and decreases the
program size at the cost of compilation time.

- -Wall All of the above '-W' options combined. This enables all the warnings about constructions that some
  users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in
  conjunction with macros.
- -g Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format (stabs is the default for the
  MC68000). GDB can work with this debugging information. Note that the tigcc frontend defaults to DWARF 2
  debugging information instead, see Options Available in the Command Line Compiler. The following options are
  useful when GCC is generated with the capability for more than one debugging format.
- -O/-O1 With '-O', the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time, without performing any
  optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time.
- -O2 Optimize even more.
- -D name or -D name=definition - Predefine name as a macro.
** used header files
C++ header files:
- `gcc -print-prog-name=cc1plus` -v
C header files:
- `gcc -print-prog-name=cpp` -v

 In addition, gcc will look in the directories specified after the -I option.
** steps
- Preprocessor (code.c -> code.i)
- Assembly code (code.i -> code.s)
- Object code (code.s -> code.o)
- Linker (code.o -> a.out)

* toolchain
a set of programming tools that is used to perform a complex software development task or to create a software
 product. Simple software development toolchain may consist of a compiler and linker, libraries, and a
 debugger.

** GNU toolchain
- GNU make: an automation tool for compilation and build
- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC): a suite of compilers for several programming languages
- GNU C Library (glibc): core C library including headers, libraries, and dynamic loader
- GNU Binutils: a suite of tools including linker, assembler and other tools
- GNU Bison: a parser generator, often used with the Flex lexical analyser
- GNU m4: an m4 macro processor
- GNU Debugger (GDB): a code debugging tool
- GNU Autotools (GNU Build System): Autoconf, Automake and Libtool
** GNU Autotools
designed to assist in making source code packages portable to many Unix-like systems.
- two-step process: configure followed by make

autoconf - generates a *configure* script based on the contents of a *configure.ac* file. The configure
 script, when run, scans the build environment and generates a subordinate *config.status* script which, in
 turn, converts other input files and most commonly Makefile.in into output files (*Makefile*), which are
 appropriate for that build environment.

automake - generate Makefile.in as an alternative to configure script, which is used to generate portable
 *Makefile*
- performs automatic dependency tracking

Libtool - helps manage the creation of static and dynamic libraries on various Unix-like operating
 systems. Libtool accomplishes this by abstracting the library-creation process, hiding differences between
 various systems (e.g. Linux systems vs. Solaris).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autoconf-automake-process.svg
*** Components:
- sys-devel/autoconf

** GNU make and Makefile
makefile is a confuguration file for *make* utility. make utility will determine automatically which pieces of
 a large program need to be recompiled.

- make -n : dry run
- -k ,tells make to keep going when an error is found
- -f ,which allows you to tell make which file to use as its makefile

targets without Makefile:
make -np | grep PHONY
: .PHONY: all clean depend install uninstall
*** theory
Build automation tool.
- "Makefile" - configuration file for projects.
- *make* command - GNU make implementation
- determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to
  recompile them
- POSIX includes standardization of the basic features and operation of the Make utility, and is implemented
  with varying degrees of completeness in Unix-based versions of Make
- newline character marks the end of a statement ("line-based" syntax).
- make updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files that have been modified since the target was last
  modified, or if the target does not exist.

make steps:
- last-modification times of target and PREREQUISITIES or if TARGET file is not exist
  - Without arguments, Make builds the first target that appears in its makefile, which is traditionally a
    symbolic "phony" target named *all*.
  - it fails when a file changes but its modification time stays in the past
- For each of those files, it issues the recipes recorded in the data base.
- default target is the first target

*** most important conventions (AI)
- *default target is the first target* "default goal". Makefiles are processed from top to bottom.
- *Target names are lowercase*
- *Variable names are uppercase*
- *Use tabs for indentation* - not spaces
- *Line of target with dependencies as outlines*
- Use := for simple assignments
- Use ?= for conditional assignments
- Use @ to suppress command echoing ~@echo "Building..."~
- Use .PHONY for non-file targets.  Use the .PHONY target to specify that a target is not a file, such as
  .PHONY: clean.
- Keep Makefiles organized: Keep Makefiles organized by grouping related targets and variables together, and
  using comments to explain what each section does.
*** make
facts:
- make starts with the first target (can be override with .DEFAULT_GOAL special variable)
- '-j' or '--jobs' option tells 'make' to execute many recipes simultaneously.


- make all − It compiles everything so that you can do local testing before installing applications.
- make install − It installs applications at right places.
- make clean − It cleans applications, gets rid of the executables, any temporary files, object files, etc.

*** Makefile
**** terms
- rule :: files to build “rule's targets” and “prerequisites” of the target. TARGETS : PREREQUISITES ; RECIPE
- recipe :: command use to create or update the target. ex. “cc -c -g foo.c”
- include :: include content of file to Makefile.
- define :: create a macro or multi-line variable, contain multiple lines of Makefile content.

**** basic
#+begin_src makefile
target … : prerequisites … ; recipe …
        recipe
        …
#+end_src
A Rule consist of:
- A "target" name of a file that is generated by a program, or name of an action to carry out.
  - if target is not a name of a file (phony target), it will be executed only when: make "target".
  - .PHONY: clean - annotate that "clean" can not be a file.
- A "prerequisite" is a file or files that is used as input to create the target. (optional)
- A "recipe" is an action that 'make' carries out.
  - you need to put a tab character at the beginning of every recipe line!
  - Usually a recipe is in a rule with prerequisites and serves to create a target file if any of the
    prerequisites change.
  - if recipe failed - falt - current target failed and any other that depends on it will not be executed
  - -RECIPE - "-" to ignore error, but prints out error message
    - -i or --ignore-errors
    - -k --keep-going - to test as many of the changes made in the program as possible
    - by default corrypted TARGET is not deleted.
    - When a line starts with '@', the echoing of that line is suppressed.

Split lines:
- \ - add white space
- $\ - without adding whitespace

comment line - # - at any place

**** example
#+NAME: just make or make prog1 or make prog2
#+begin_src makefile
all : prog1 prog2 prog3
.PHONY : all

prog1 : prog1.o utils.o
        cc -o prog1 prog1.o utils.o

prog2 : prog2.o
        cc -o prog2 prog2.o

prog3 : prog3.o sort.o utils.o
        cc -o prog3 prog3.o sort.o utils.o
#+end_src
#+NAME: alternative to .PHONY: clean
#+begin_src makefile
clean: FORCE
        rm $(objects)
FORCE:
#+end_src
If a rule has no prerequisites or recipe, and the target of the rule is a nonexistent file, then make imagines
  this target to have been updated whenever its rule is run.
*** Special Built-in Target Names
.PHONY: clean - clean target will be executed regardless of existence of file "clear"

'.SUFFIXES'

  - The prerequisites of the special target '.SUFFIXES' are the list of suffixes to be used in checking for
    suffix rules.  *Note Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules: Suffix Rules.

'.DEFAULT'

     The recipe specified for '.DEFAULT' is used for any target for
     which no rules are found (either explicit rules or implicit rules).
     *Note Last Resort::.  If a '.DEFAULT' recipe is specified, every
     file mentioned as a prerequisite, but not as a target in a rule,
     will have that recipe executed on its behalf.  *Note Implicit Rule
     Search Algorithm: Implicit Rule Search.

'.PRECIOUS'

     The targets which '.PRECIOUS' depends on are given the following
     special treatment: if 'make' is killed or interrupted during the
     execution of their recipes, the target is not deleted.  *Note
     Interrupting or Killing 'make': Interrupts.  Also, if the target is
     an intermediate file, it will not be deleted after it is no longer
     needed, as is normally done.  *Note Chains of Implicit Rules:
     Chained Rules.  In this latter respect it overlaps with the
     '.SECONDARY' special target.

     You can also list the target pattern of an implicit rule (such as
     '%.o') as a prerequisite file of the special target '.PRECIOUS' to
     preserve intermediate files created by rules whose target patterns
     match that file's name.

'.INTERMEDIATE'

     The targets which '.INTERMEDIATE' depends on are treated as
     intermediate files.  *Note Chains of Implicit Rules: Chained Rules.
     '.INTERMEDIATE' with no prerequisites has no effect.

'.SECONDARY'

     The targets which '.SECONDARY' depends on are treated as
     intermediate files, except that they are never automatically
     deleted.  *Note Chains of Implicit Rules: Chained Rules.

     '.SECONDARY' with no prerequisites causes all targets to be treated
     as secondary (i.e., no target is removed because it is considered
     intermediate).

'.SECONDEXPANSION'

     If '.SECONDEXPANSION' is mentioned as a target anywhere in the
     makefile, then all prerequisite lists defined _after_ it appears
     will be expanded a second time after all makefiles have been read
     in.  *Note Secondary Expansion: Secondary Expansion.

'.DELETE_ON_ERROR'

     If '.DELETE_ON_ERROR' is mentioned as a target anywhere in the
     makefile, then 'make' will delete the target of a rule if it has
     changed and its recipe exits with a nonzero exit status, just as it
     does when it receives a signal.  *Note Errors in Recipes: Errors.

'.IGNORE'

     If you specify prerequisites for '.IGNORE', then 'make' will ignore
     errors in execution of the recipe for those particular files.  The
     recipe for '.IGNORE' (if any) is ignored.

     If mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, '.IGNORE' says to
     ignore errors in execution of recipes for all files.  This usage of
     '.IGNORE' is supported only for historical compatibility.  Since
     this affects every recipe in the makefile, it is not very useful;
     we recommend you use the more selective ways to ignore errors in
     specific recipes.  *Note Errors in Recipes: Errors.

'.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME'

     If you specify prerequisites for '.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME', 'make'
     assumes that these files are created by commands that generate low
     resolution time stamps.  The recipe for the '.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME'
     target are ignored.

     The high resolution file time stamps of many modern file systems
     lessen the chance of 'make' incorrectly concluding that a file is
     up to date.  Unfortunately, some hosts do not provide a way to set
     a high resolution file time stamp, so commands like 'cp -p' that
     explicitly set a file's time stamp must discard its sub-second
     part.  If a file is created by such a command, you should list it
     as a prerequisite of '.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME' so that 'make' does not
     mistakenly conclude that the file is out of date.  For example:

          .LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME: dst
          dst: src
                  cp -p src dst

     Since 'cp -p' discards the sub-second part of 'src''s time stamp,
     'dst' is typically slightly older than 'src' even when it is up to
     date.  The '.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME' line causes 'make' to consider
     'dst' to be up to date if its time stamp is at the start of the
     same second that 'src''s time stamp is in.

     Due to a limitation of the archive format, archive member time
     stamps are always low resolution.  You need not list archive
     members as prerequisites of '.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME', as 'make' does
     this automatically.

'.SILENT'

     If you specify prerequisites for '.SILENT', then 'make' will not
     print the recipe used to remake those particular files before
     executing them.  The recipe for '.SILENT' is ignored.

     If mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, '.SILENT' says not
     to print any recipes before executing them.  You may also use more
     selective ways to silence specific recipe command lines.  *Note
     Recipe Echoing: Echoing.  If you want to silence all recipes for a
     particular run of 'make', use the '-s' or '--silent' option (*note
     Options Summary::).

'.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES'

     Simply by being mentioned as a target, this tells 'make' to export
     all variables to child processes by default.  *Note Communicating
     Variables to a Sub-'make': Variables/Recursion.

'.NOTPARALLEL'

     If '.NOTPARALLEL' is mentioned as a target, then this invocation of
     'make' will be run serially, even if the '-j' option is given.  Any
     recursively invoked 'make' command will still run recipes in
     parallel (unless its makefile also contains this target).  Any
     prerequisites on this target are ignored.

'.ONESHELL'

     If '.ONESHELL' is mentioned as a target, then when a target is
     built all lines of the recipe will be given to a single invocation
     of the shell rather than each line being invoked separately (*note
     Recipe Execution: Execution.).

'.POSIX'

     If '.POSIX' is mentioned as a target, then the makefile will be
     parsed and run in POSIX-conforming mode.  This does _not_ mean that
     only POSIX-conforming makefiles will be accepted: all advanced GNU
     'make' features are still available.  Rather, this target causes
     'make' to behave as required by POSIX in those areas where 'make''s
     default behavior differs.
**** '.SUFFIXES'
to define own implisit rule:
.SUFFIXES: .foo .bar
.foo.bar:
   tr '[A-Z][a-z]' '[N-Z][A-M][n-z][a-m]' < $< > $@
*** variables
- case sensitive
- name not contain - not containing ':','#', '=', or whitespace
- lower names recommended

make -e, --environment-overrides Give variables taken from the environment precedence over variables from makefiles.

**** types
- recursive (‘=’)
- simple (‘:=’ or ‘::=’)
- immediate (‘::=’)
- appending (‘+=’)
- conditional (‘?=’)
- automatic variables $@, $%
target-specific variable value like this: target … : variable-assignment
**** Special Variable
: .DEFAULT_GOAL := foo

- .DEFAULT_GOAL - Sets the default goal to be used if no targets were specified on the command line
- MAKEFILE_LIST - Contains the name of each makefile that is parsed by make, in the order in which it was parsed
- MAKE_RESTARTS - the number of times this instance has restarted (set only if this instance of make has restarted)
- .RECIPEPREFIX - if the variable is empty (as it is by default) that character is the standard tab character
- .VARIABLES - Expands to a list of the names of all global variables defined so far.
- .FEATURES - Expands to a list of special features supported by this version of make.
- .INCLUDE_DIRS - Expands to a list of directories that make searches for included makefiles
- .EXTRA_PREREQS - Each word in this variable is a new prerequisite which is added to targets for which it is set.

**** Computed Variable Names
x = y
y = z
a := $($(x))
a will be z
**** automatic variables
make -p to get default variables

- '$@' The file name of the target of the rule. In a pattern rule that has multiple targets '$@' is the name
  of whichever target caused the rule's recipe to be run.
- '$%' The target member name, when the target is an archive member.  *Note Archives::.  For example, if the
  target is 'foo.a(bar.o)' then '$%' is 'bar.o' and '$@' is 'foo.a'.  '$%' is empty when the target is not an
  archive member.
- '$<' The name of the first prerequisite. If the target got its recipe from an implicit rule, this will be
  the first prerequisite added by the implicit rule (*note Implicit Rules::).
- '$?' The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target, with spaces between them. If the
  target does not exist, all prerequisites will be included.  For prerequisites which are archive members,
  only the named member is used
- '$^' The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.  For prerequisites which are archive
  members, only the named member is used This list does *not* contain any of the order-only prerequisites; for
  those see the '$|' variable, below.
- '$+' This is like '$^', but prerequisites listed more than once are duplicated in the order they were listed
  in the makefile.  This is primarily useful for use in linking commands where it is meaningful to repeat
  library file names in a particular order.
- '$|' The names of all the order-only prerequisites, with spaces between them.
- '$*' The stem with which an implicit rule matches/ If the target is 'dir/a.foo.b' and the target pattern is
  'a.%.b' then the stem is 'dir/foo'.  The stem is useful for constructing names of related files.

'$(@D)' The directory part of the file name of the target, with the trailing slash removed.  If the value of
     '$@' is 'dir/foo.o' then '$(@D)' is 'dir'.  This value is '.' if '$@' does not contain a slash.

etc.
**** rules examples:
#+NAME redefine command line parameters:
#+begin_src makefile
all:
	$(MAKE) $@ -C $(SUBDIRS)
#+end_src
**** ex
#+begin_src makefile
     objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \

     edit : $(objects)
             cc -o edit $(objects)
#+end_src

*** Implicit Rules
- main.o : defs.h - rule will be executed implisitly: cc -c main.c -o main.o
- A file that is mentioned only as a prerequisite is considered a target whose rule specifies nothing, so
  implicit rule search happens for it.
- to prohibit implisit rule create empty recipie with use ";":
  - target: ;

**** some variables used by implicit rules are:
- CC: Program for compiling C programs; default cc
- CXX: Program for compiling C++ programs; default g++
- CFLAGS: Extra flags to give to the C compiler
- CXXFLAGS: Extra flags to give to the C++ compiler
- CPPFLAGS: Extra flags to give to the C preprocessor
- LDFLAGS: Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker
**** some of implicit rules
- Compiling C programs N.o N.c: '$(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c'
- Compiling C++ programs N.o N.cc N.cpp '$(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -c'
- Compiling Pascal programs N.o N.p '$(PC) $(PFLAGS) -c'
- Compiling Fortran and Ratfor programs N.o N.r N.F N.r
- Preprocessing Fortran and Ratfor programs N.f N.F N.r
- Compiling Modula-2 programs
- Assembling and preprocessing assembler programs N.o N.s '$(AS) $(ASFLAGS)'
  - N.s N.S '$(CPP) $(CPPFLAGS)'
- Linking a single object file N N.o '$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) N.o $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS)'
  - (linker (usually called 'ld') via the C compiler)
- Yacc for C programs N.c N.y $(YACC) $(YFLAGS)'
- Lex for C programs N.r N.l '$(LEX) $(LFLAGS)'

** cmake
- file: CMakeLists.txt.
- License: BSD-3-Clause


Mainly for C++
- a cross-platform tool; the idea is to have a single definition of how the project is built - which
  translates into specific build definitions for any supported platform.
- On Linux, CMake generates Makefiles; on Windows, it can generate Visual Studio projects, and so on.
- Build behavior is defined in CMakeLists.txt files - one in every directory of the source code
- CMake commands are case insensitive
*** buils stage
1. standard build files (usually scripts) (e.g. Unix Makefiles for make) are created (generated) from
 configuration files (CMakeLists.txt) which are written in CMake language
2. platform's native build tools (native toolchain) are used for actual building of programs.
*** usage
should be CMakeLists.txt and may be CMake folder with .cmake files
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/bin/folder
- cmake --build .
- uninstall cmake: xargs rm < install_manifest.txt # to remove

make
- make
- make check
- make install
- make uninstall

access /usr/local/lib:
: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib

* pkg-config
- program is used to retrieve information about installed libraries in the system. It is typically used to
 compile and link against one or more libraries.
- helper tool which is used to obtain compiler & linker flags when building a package depending on a library.
- The primary use of pkg-config is to provide the necessary details for compiling and linking a program to a
  library.

- Without a metadata system such as pkg-config, it can be very difficult to locate and obtain details about
  the services provided on a given computer
- This metadata is stored in pkg-config files.
- pkg-config files (.pc) are simple data files which usually will distribute or generate automatically in
  famous packages. They combine with pkg-config command to produce the necessary command line for to compile
  and link.

Here is a typical usage scenario in a Makefile:
: program: program.c
:        cc program.c ‘pkg-config --cflags --libs gnomeui‘

in tdlib:
- CMake/GeneratePkgConfig.cmake
- in CMakeLists.txt :
  - include(GeneratePkgConfig)
- its generate .pc files for .so and .a in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/
* ldconfig
ldconfig creates the necessary links and cache to the most recent shared libraries found in the directories
 specified on the command line, in the file /etc/ld.so.conf

symlinks pattern:
- libfoo.so -> libfoo.so.1 -> libfoo.so.1.12
* GNU Libtool
- works implicitly. pkg-config needs to be used explicitly.
- is a generic library support script that hides the complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent,
  portable interface.
- add the new generic library building commands to your Makefile, Makefile.in, or Makefile.am
- libtool is used by Autoconf and Automake, two other portability tools in the GNU build system. It can also be used directly.
* debug
  https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/C(2f)Debugging.html
Emacs: M-x gdb and then M-x gdb-many-windows is way more better than dap mode
** Assertions
- #include <assert.h>
- assert(2+2 == 5);
** gdb
- ddd - graphical interface
- C and C++ programs
- *Debugging Symbol Table* maps instructions in the compiled binary program to their corresponding variable,
  function, or line in the source code.
  - gcc -g hello.cc -o hello - debugging option (-g)
- a.out is the default executable name generated by the gcc

*** alternatives:
- dev-util/kdevelop - GPL-2
- Eclipse - Eclipse Public License
*** backtrace
1. Find one thing you know the code does, and trace those actions backward, starting at the end.
2. Figure out where in the code — the specific, few lines — it generates that file.
** Valgrind
dev-util/valgrind

- Generate a callgrind.out.<PID> file.
  - valgrind --tool=callgrind ./main
- generate graph.png using gprof2dot
  - ./gprof2dot.py --format=callgrind --output=out.dot /path/to/callgrind.out
  - dot -Tpng out.dot -o graph.png
** print - bad approach
The problem is :
1) no built-in test to see if the output is actually what you'd expect
2) you can't change your mind about what is getting printed out without editing the code
3) output can be misleading: in particular, printf output is usually buffered, which means that if your
   program dies suddenly there may be output still in the buffer that is never flushed to stdout. This can be
   very confusing, and can lead you to believe that your program fails earlier than it actually does.

solving:
- use assert
- Use fprintf(stderr, ...) instead of printf(...); - output to stderr is usually unbuffered
- If you must output to stdout, put fflush(stdout) after
- Keep all arguments passed to printf as simple as possible and beware of faults in your debugging code itself.
*** ex
gcc -DDEBUG -o printarea printarea.c
#+begin_src c
#ifdef DEBUG
	printf("%s", msg);
#else
	(void)msg; // ignore msg
#endif
}
#+end_src
* install /usr/local/bin

install -m 755 -s $(TARGET) /usr/local/bin/


* Difference between C and C++ and Objective-C
- Major added features in C++ are Object-Oriented Programming, Exception Handling and rich C++ Library.
- C++ is a superset of C.
- C contains 32 keywords.	C++ contains 63 keywords.
- C supports procedural programming. C++ is known as hybrid language because C++ supports both procedural and
  object oriented programming paradigms.
- C++ supports user-defined data types
- Function and operator overloading is supported by C++.
- Namespace is used by C++, which avoid name collisions.
- Header file used by C is stdio.h.	Header file used by C++ is iostream.h.
- Reference variables are supported by C++.
- Virtual and friend functions are supported by C++.
- C++ provides new operator for memory allocation and delete operator for memory de-allocation.
- C provides malloc() and calloc() functions for dynamic memory allocation, and free() for memory de-allocation.
- scanf() and printf() functions are used for input/output in C. cin and cout are used for input/output in
  C++.
- C structures don’t have access modifiers. C ++ structures have access modifiers.
- char[] represents string literals in C (mutable). C++ has a variable type called string. As this variable
  type is immutable
- C++ allows using a function with default arguments, C doesn’t.
- GUI: C has the GTK tool. C++ supports Qt tools for achieving the same.
- int f() - in C is a function with arbitrarry number of argumens. In C++ with no arguments.
- result of assignment a = b - in C evaluates to the same value as the expression b, C++ - as expression a.
** Objective-C
Objective-C is a general-purpose programming language that enhances C with the Smalltalk-style messaging.
- for iOS and OS X operating systems for Apple products.
- object-oriented
- Objective-C does not offer multiple inheritance
- C++ uses true and false for bool, while Objective-C works with YES and NO for BOOL.
- Smalltalk messaging paradigm in which you transfer so-called messages to objects through functions or selectors.
- C++ manages structs and classes the same, Objective-C treats them completely differently.
- In theory, Objective-C is slower than C++ because of the dynamic method dispatch.

* C++
** TODO operators

** hello world
#+begin_src c++
#include <iostream>     // std::cin, std::cout, std::hex

int main () {
  int n;
  std::cout << "Enter a hexadecimal number: ";
  std::cin >> std::hex >> n;         // manipulator
  std::cout << "Its decimal equivalent is: " << n << '\n';

  return 0;
}
#+end_src

** libs
: #include <cstdio> # c library include <stdio.h>

** RAII ideom (Resource Acquisition is Initialization )
- Encapsulate a resource into a class (constructor)
- Use the resource via a local instance of the class
- The resource is automatically released when the object gets out of scope (restructor)

Implication 1: C++ does not require the garbage collector

Implication 2: The programmer has the responsibility to manage the resource
