The Basics of Commodities Trading

CME Commodity Trading Manual 2006 [[/home/ff/Downloads/ChickMan.pdf]] https://www.le.ac.uk/users/dsgp1/COURSES/DERIVATE/RESOURCE/ChickMan.pdf

** theory
*** differences:
- Elasitcity :: Electricity(low) vs Gold(high) - said: “elastic demand”. Refers to how responsive the demand for a
  commodity is to changes in its price. Commodities with low elasticity have a stable demand, regardless of
  price fluctuations, while those with high elasticity have a demand that can change significantly with price
  changes.
- Deliverability :: Natural gas (high) vs Lean hogs (low) - how ease and speed with which a commodity can be
  transported and delivered to various markets.
- Substitability :: Coffee (high) vs Gasoline (low) - can be replaced by other products or
  alternatives. Commodities with high substitutability have many alternatives, making demand more responsive
  to price changes, while those with low substitutability have limited alternatives, making demand less
  responsive.
- Storability :: Animals (low) vs Aluminum (high) - stored for extended periods without significant degradation or loss of
  value. Commodities with high storability can be kept in inventory for long periods, while those with low
  storability require immediate use or processing.
- Exchange Prices vs Local Prices :: Natural gas at Henry Hub (stable) vs Natural gas at source (local
  variable)
- Timing vs Production :: Winter wheat (low sensitive to weather) vs Spring wheat (high sensisitve) - seasonal
  patterns of a commodity, some commodities have specific timing requirements, such as planting and harvesting
  seasons, which can affect their yield and availability.

*** Cash, Forward, futures, options
- Cash sales :: deliver to offline market and sell with the price for the day.
- Forward contracts :: P2P, Contract not standardized. Negotiated now for delivery later for specified price
  at the time of delivery. You are protected if prices fall.
- Futures contracts :: P2B. Contract standardized. (like forward) agreement to buy or sell a commodity at a
  date in the future. Buy or sell throught a brokerage firm that transacts the trade for you. You must deposit
  a “performance bound” (a small percentage of the contract value). *Specifies everythin but the price.*
- options on futures contracs :: P2P
- Option :: P2P, buyer purchases the right but not the obligation to buy an agreed quantity of a
  particular commodity or financial instrument (the underlying) from the seller of the option at a certain
  time (the expiration date) for a certain price (the strike price). The seller (or "writer") is obligated to
  sell the commodity or financial instrument should the buyer so decide. The buyer pays a fee (called a
  premium) for this right.
  - call option (to buy something at price) ::  The holder of a call option hopes that the price of the
    underlying asset will rise above the strike price, allowing them to buy the asset at the lower strike
    price and sell it at the higher market price later.
  - put option (to sell something at price) :: gives the holder the right to sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price, known as
    the strike price. The holder of a put option hopes that the price of the underlying asset will fall below
    the strike price, allowing them to sell the asset at the higher strike price and buy it back at the lower
    market price later.

“sell forward contracts” - I get agreement to sell a commodity or asset at a future date, at a predetermined
 price.
*** other contracts
**** swap
 derivative contract, s exchanging one type of cash flow for another. In commodity trading, swaps are
  used to hedge against price risks or to speculate on price movements.


Ex. Suppose a farmer wants to hedge against a potential decline in the price of wheat. They enter into a swap
 contract with a bank, agreeing to exchange a fixed price of $200 per ton of wheat for a floating price based
 on the market price of wheat. If the market price of wheat falls to $180 per ton, the farmer will receive $20
 per ton from the bank, which will help offset the loss in revenue. Types of swaps:

Types
 - Fixed-for-floating swap: Exchanges a fixed price for a floating price.
 - Floating-for-floating swap: Exchanges one floating price for another floating price.
 - Basis swap: Exchanges a fixed price for a floating price, with the floating price based on a specific
   market index.
**** TODO Exchange-traded commodities (ETCs)

*** *Hedging*
(minimise or remove price risk) - by taking an opposite position in the futures market.

Example: Suppose you have a forward contract to sell 1,000 barrels of oil at $50 per barrel in three
 months. To hedge this position, you could:

- Buy a futures contract: Buy a futures contract for 1,000 barrels of oil at $50 per barrel, expiring in three
  months. This would offset the risk of the forward contract.
- Buy a call option: Buy a call option to buy 1,000 barrels of oil at $50 per barrel, expiring in three
  months. This would give you the right, but not the obligation, to buy oil at $50 per barrel, reducing the
  risk of the forward contract.

*** open interest and Bull/Bear market

 and gives us trand.

*Bull* One who expect prices to rise
